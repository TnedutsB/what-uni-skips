## A.1) Can you tick me? (5 P.)
- [ ] To complete this task, you must check this checkbox
Because I want my checkboxes like this:
- [x] Nice checkbox
and not like this:
- [ ] Silly checkbox

  <summary>
  ðŸ’¡
  </summary>
    This apparently only works on your own computer... so you'll need to
    clone the repo.
</details>

## A.2) The only question (6 P.)
### Question: **What is the answer to everything?**
    You get full points for the correct
    answer, even without justification. If you're not sure, explain
    your approach to get partial points.
### Your answer
<details>
  <summary>
  ðŸ’¡
  </summary>
    Ask the one who knows everything ->
    look in the files here to see if you can find
    something that might know everything.
</details>

## A.3) It's heavy and worth little (6 P.)
### Stone in the box
Your next task is to put a stone in a box. Something like this:
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ der-wisser-allens.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ Readme.md
    â””â”€â”€ Schachtel
        â””â”€â”€ Stein
Please do this using the terminal. Which commands did you use?
### Answer (your commands and brief explanation)
<details>
  <summary>
  ðŸ’¡
  </summary>
    I want you to create a folder named Schachtel and within it
    an empty file named Stein.
</details>

## A.4) Have you even learned? (7 P.)
### Enough games; What do the following commands do? A brief point is enough
| Command          | Function |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| ls               |          |
| cd               |          |
| mkdir            |          |
| touch            |          |
| man              |          |
| cat              |          |
| rm               |          |
| cp               |          |
| mv               |          |
| extra point: pwd |          |

## A.5) Something useful (6 P.)
Make your solutions available to me in a separate Git branch `your-name-loesung` on
GitHub.
Bonus (2p): Create a pull request to the `main` branch and make me (jbefus)
the reviewer.

**Good luck!**
